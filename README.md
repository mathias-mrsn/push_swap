# push_swap

**push_swap** is a project from the **42** Common Core, The project aims to create your first sort algorithm using a limited number of operation. The goal of this project isn't to creat the fastest algorithm but to creat a algorithm using less operations as possible 

### Usage

    $> make
    $> ARG="<numbers>"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

## bonus

Create your own checker who takes in *stdin* your operations that apply them to your stack. Then print "OK" or "KO" is your stack is sorted. It must respect the same rule that the reel tester gave in the subject
